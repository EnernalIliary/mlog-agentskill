"""Every rule must fire on at least one fixture, and every fixture rid set is pinned.

Why this exists: tests/expected.json digests store (sev, line), but only three of the
39 rules are asserted with their rule id, so rewording a message silently re-classifies
a finding (rule_ids.py picks the longest matching msg_any substring) without any test
turning red. rule_capture.py lint only proves a rule does NOT fire on its own counter
example -- a rule that never fires anywhere passes that test too.

Inputs : rules/*.json (id, severity, state, msg_any) + tests/cases/*.mlog
Output : tests/rule-coverage.json  {rid: [case, ...]}   (--write)
Exit   : 0 all clean / 1 something to fix / 2 cannot run
