"""Seed ``rules/*.json`` — one record per thing this project had to learn the hard way.

Why a directory of JSON instead of prose: a rule is only "learned" if it can be
re-run. Each record carries three things that prose cannot:

  * ``match``        — how to find its findings in a corpus (so R2 can count them),
  * ``counter_example`` — a fixture that must NOT fire (so it cannot silently widen),
  * ``source``/``ref``  — who said it and when (a rule with no source is a guess).

``kind`` separates the three kinds of knowledge that look alike in a report:

  ``semantics``  the game does X; verified in source or by the user. Not a style call.
  ``heuristic``  "this usually means a mistake" — a statistical claim, downgradable.
  ``negative``   something that LOOKS wrong but is correct. Recorded so the rule that
                 would have flagged it never comes back. These are the cheapest rules
                 to own and the easiest to lose.

Usage::

    python tools/rule_seed.py            # write rules/*.json (idempotent, keeps edits)
    python tools/rule_seed.py --force    # overwrite existing records

# A rule's ``line_regex`` is what makes R2's precision number mean something: it re-checks
# that the source line still looks like the thing the rule claims to detect. Only rules
# whose finding carries the offending LINE in its third field get one. Program-level
# findings (version gate, dead polarity, null guard) carry a token instead, so for those
# precision is honestly unmeasurable rather than falsely 100%.
