"""Name a finding by the rule in rules/*.json that claims it.

The analyzer emits prose ("... is never assigned anywhere in this program"),
while each rules/*.json file matches that prose through match.sevs +
match.msg_any. tools/rule_capture.py:matches() is the reference reading of
those fields. Consumers used to re-implement the matching (the corpus sweep
did, and its report ended up showing statement text in the rule column), so
this module holds the single definition and mlogcheck stamps every Finding with
its rule id at construction time.

The rules directory is $MLOG_RULES_DIR if set, else the nearest rules/ with at
least one JSON file in the four directories above this module. Walking upwards
matters because tools/ ships in mirrors at different depths:
<repo>/tools (one level up) and <repo>/mindustry-blueprint/tools (two levels
up, with no rules/ of its own -- yet the test suite imports that copy and must
still name findings). A tree packaged without rules/ (the standalone skill)
yields rule_id() = None for everything instead of raising, and callers fall back
to the statement text -- the pre-2026-10-26 behaviour.
